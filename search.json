    "text": "The Challenge\nStandard credit risk models optimize for accuracy (F1-score), treating a $500 default the same as a $50,000 default. In finance, this is a mistake. Accuracy does not pay the bills; Profit does.\n\n\nThe Solution\nI built a custom “Profit-Centric” optimization engine that: 1. Re-engineers the Target: Shifts focus from “Did they default?” to “What is the Expected Loss?” 2. Simulates P&L: Calculates the “Efficient Frontier” of approval rates. 3. Optimizes Decisioning: Recommends a cutoff that maximizes Net Portfolio Profit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Result\n\n\n\nThe model identified $1.26M in uncaptured value and projected a 40% ROI lift by rejecting the riskiest 17.3% of applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Efficiency Frontier: Finding the optimal approval rate\n\n\nFigure 1: By shifting the approval threshold from 100% to 82.7%, we avoid the “tail risk” (massive losses) while retaining the profitable core.\n\n\nTechnical Architecture\nThis was not just a notebook experiment. I built a modular Python package to handle the pipeline: * Pipelines: Custom scikit-learn transformers to prevent data leakage. * Feature Engineering: Derived financial metrics (Principal, Installment-to-Income) using annuity formulas. * Explainability: Used SHAP values to prove that FICO and Inquiry Velocity are the primary risk drivers.\n\n\nView the Code\nThis project is structured as a production-ready Python package.\n View on GitHub"
