    "text": "Executive Summary\nIn consumer lending, accuracy is a misleading metric. A model that blindly predicts “No Default” can achieve 85% accuracy but bankrupt a lender by missing the few massive defaults.\nThis project re-engineers the credit scoring process by shifting the optimization objective from Statistical Accuracy (F1-Score) to Economic Profit.\nBy developing a modular classification engine and applying a custom profit-maximization threshold, this strategy achieved:\n\nFinancial Impact: Projected portfolio value of $1.26M, a ~40% ROI lift over the baseline.\nRisk Policy: Identified an optimal cutoff rejecting the riskiest 17.3% of applicants.\nModel Performance: Achieved a 0.685 ROC-AUC using a defensible, regulator-friendly Logistic Regression model.\n\n\n\n\n1. The Business Problem\n\nAsymmetry of Errors\nIn credit risk, confusion matrix errors are not created equal:\n\nFalse Positive (Type I Error): We reject a good applicant. Cost = Opportunity Cost of Interest.\nFalse Negative (Type II Error): We approve a defaulter. Cost = Loss of Principal.\n\nSince the Principal is significantly larger than the Interest, avoiding False Negatives is mathematically more critical than avoiding False Positives. Standard “out-of-the-box” machine learning models often fail to capture this asymmetry by themselves.\n\n\nThe Objective\nBuild a system that answers: “What is the exact probability threshold that maximizes Net Portfolio Profit?”\n\n\n\n\n2. System Architecture\nTo ensure reproducibility and prevent data leakage, I moved beyond ad-hoc notebooks to a production-grade modular architecture.\n\nDirectory Structure\nThe project is organized as a Python package (src), separating business logic from training pipelines.\n├── src/\n│   ├── data_pipeline.py  # Custom Transformers (Financial Engineering)\n│   ├── training.py       # Cross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning\n│   ├── evaluation.py     # Profit & Strategy Curve Logic\n│   └── config.py         # Centralized Assumptions\n├── notebooks/            # Narrative Analysis\n└── README.md\n\n\nFeature Engineering Pipeline\nA critical component was the FinancialFeatureEngineer transformer, which derives economic variables before the model sees the data. This calculates the Present Value (PV) of the loan using standard amortization formulas.\n# src/data_pipeline.py Snippet\n\ndef engineer_financial_features(df):\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives the Principal (PV) using the Annuity Formula.\n    PV = Installment * (1 - (1+r)^-n) / r\n    \"\"\"\n    monthly_rate = df['int.rate'] / 12\n    term = 36 # Assumed 36-month term\n    \n    # Vectorized Calculation of Risk Exposure\n    df['principal'] = df['installment'] * (\n        1 - (1 + monthly_rate)**(-term)\n    ) / monthly_rate\n    \n    return df\n\n\n\n\n3. Modeling Strategy\n\nModel Selection\nI benchmarked three architectures:\n\nLogistic Regression: Linear, highly interpretable (industry standard for compliance).\nRandom Forest: Handles non-linearities but prone to overfitting on noise.\nXGBoost: Gradient boosting for maximizing weak signals.\n\nWinner: Logistic Regression. Surprisingly, the simpler linear model outperformed the complex tree ensembles on the test set (AUC 0.685 vs 0.67 & 0.66 respectively). This suggests the signal in this specific dataset is largely linear (e.g., FICO scores linearly correlate with risk), and the complex models were overfitting the noise.\n\n\nThe “Strategy Curve”\nInstead of accepting the default decision threshold of 0.5, I implemented a custom evaluation function to plot Profit vs. Approval Rate.\n\nX-Axis: Percentage of loans approved (sorted by safety).\nY-Axis: Total Portfolio Profit.\n\n This visualization allows stakeholders to visually “pick” their risk appetite.\n\n\n\n\n4. Results & Analysis\n\nPerformance Metrics\nThe final model demonstrated robust separation power between “Good” and “Bad” loans.\n\nROC-AUC: 0.685\nPrecision (Class 0 - Paid): 0.86\nRecall (Class 1 - Default): Tunable via threshold.\n\n\n\nBusiness Insight: The Optimization Peak\nThe analysis revealed a convex profit curve.\n\nAt 100% Approval: The portfolio absorbs all toxic assets, significantly reducing net profit.\nAt 82.7% Approval (The Peak): By cutting the bottom 17.3% of risky applicants, we maximize profit at $1,264,043.\nBelow 80% Approval: We start rejecting too many good customers, and the opportunity cost (lost interest) begins to outweigh the savings from avoided defaults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagerial Conclusion: The optimal policy is strict but not draconian. We should approve the safest ~83% of applicants. This creates a projected 40% increase in profitability compared to a naive strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Key Risk Drivers (Interpretation)\nUsing coefficient analysis (and SHAP values for tree benchmarks), the primary drivers of default were:\n\nFICO Score: The single strongest predictor. Lower scores exponentially increase default odds.\nInquiries (Last 6 Months): A high velocity of recent credit applications is a strong distress signal.\nInterest Rate: The market is efficient—loans priced with higher rates did default more often, confirming that the original underwriters correctly identified risk (though they often underpriced it).\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis project demonstrates that Data Science is not just about prediction; it is about decision-making.\nBy translating a classification problem into a financial optimization problem, I delivered a model that speaks the language of the business: Profit, ROI, and Risk Exposure.\n\nCode Repository: View on GitHub](https://github.com/Condeg0/Loan-Default-Prediction){.btn .btn-primary role=“button”}\nTech Stack: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib."
