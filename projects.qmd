### Optimizing Credit Risk: A Profit-First Approach
![](https://placehold.co/600x400?text=Risk+Model) **Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Seaborn

**The Problem:** Standard default prediction models maximize accuracy (AUC) but often fail to maximize *profit*. A bank loses more money on a False Negative (default) than it gains from a True Negative (repayment).

**The Solution:**
I engineered a **Threshold Optimization Engine** that shifts the decision boundary based on the specific cost-benefit matrix of the loan portfolio.

* **Strategy:** Prioritized recall for high-risk segments to minimize costly defaults.
* **Result:** While raw accuracy remained comparable to baseline, the **risk-adjusted revenue** improved significantly by rejecting "borderline" applicants that standard models would have accepted.
