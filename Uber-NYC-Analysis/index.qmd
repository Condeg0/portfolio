## Project Overview
This project analyzes **4.5 million Uber pickups** in New York City to identify high-demand locations and time windows. Using **R (ggplot2, dplyr)**, I processed trip logs to answer three operational questions:
1.  **Where** are pickups concentrated?
2.  **When** does demand peak during the day?
3.  **How** does fleet activity shift between weekdays and weekends?

---

## 1. Geographic Distribution
**Question:** Is demand spread evenly across the city?

**Finding:**
The pickup density is heavily skewed.
* **Manhattan Core:** The vast majority of rides occur in Manhattan (below 59th St) and Downtown Brooklyn.
* **Airport Clusters:** Outside the city grid, the only significant hotspots are **JFK** and **LaGuardia Airports**.
* **Operational Insight:** For a driver, leaving Manhattan without an airport fare is statistically inefficient, as return trips from outer boroughs are rare.

## 2. Hourly Demand Patterns
**Question:** Is there a consistent "best time" to drive?

**Finding:**
Demand follows a strict daily cycle that is consistent across all six months (Apr–Sep).
* **The Build-Up:** Ride volume begins to rise significantly at **16:00 (4 PM)**.
* **The Peak:** The busiest hour is consistently **17:00–18:00 (5–6 PM)**, coinciding with the end of the traditional workday.
* **Late Night:** Demand tapers off after 21:00, except on weekends (see below).

## 3. Heatmap Analysis: Day vs. Hour
**Question:** How does the schedule change from Tuesday to Saturday?

![](Heat Map by Hour and Day of Week.png)

**Finding:**
Aggregating data by day of the week reveals two distinct distinct "shifts":
1.  **The Commuter Shift (Mon–Thu):** Demand is strictly focused on rush hours (07:00–09:00 and 17:00–19:00).
2.  **The Nightlife Shift (Fri–Sat):** The evening peak extends well past midnight, staying high until **02:00 AM**.

**Business Implication:** Algorithms should prioritize "commuter" routes during the week but switch to "entertainment district" positioning on Friday nights.

## 4. Base Growth (Fleet Scaling)
**Question:** Are all Uber bases growing at the same rate?

![](Trips by Base and Month.png)

**Finding:**
While most bases (like B02598 and B02682) showed stable monthly volume, **Base B02617 (Teal)** grew exponentially.
* **April:** ~30k trips
* **September:** ~180k trips
* This suggests that Uber likely consolidated drivers into this specific base or ran an aggressive onboarding campaign during the summer of 2014.

## Technical Implementation
**Stack:** R, RStudio
**Key Libraries:**
* `ggplot2`: Used for the heatmaps and bar charts.
* `lubridate`: Parsed the timestamps to extract Hour, Day, and Month factors.
* `dplyr`: Grouped the 4.5M rows for aggregation.

```r
# Code used to generate the Hourly Histogram
hour_data <- data_2014 %>%
  group_by(Hour) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Total = n())

ggplot(data = hour_data, aes(x = Hour, y = Total)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue", color = "red") +
  ggtitle("Trips By Hour")
