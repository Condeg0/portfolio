# The Challenge
Standard credit risk models optimize for accuracy (F1-score), treating a $500 default the same as a $50,000 default. In finance, this is a mistake. **Accuracy does not pay the bills; Profit does.**

# The Solution
I built a custom "Profit-Centric" optimization engine that:

1.  **Re-engineers the Target:** Shifts focus from "Did they default?" to "What is the Expected Loss?"
2.  **Simulates P&L:** Calculates the "Efficient Frontier" of approval rates.
3.  **Optimizes Decisioning:** Recommends a cutoff that maximizes Net Portfolio Profit.

## Key Result
The model identified **$1.26M in uncaptured value** and projected a **40% ROI lift** by rejecting the riskiest 17.3% of applicants.

*Figure 1: By shifting the approval threshold from 100% to 82.7%, we avoid the "tail risk" (massive losses) while retaining the profitable core.*

# Technical Architecture
This was not just a notebook experiment. I built a modular Python package to handle the pipeline:

* **Pipelines:** Custom `scikit-learn` transformers to prevent data leakage.
* **Feature Engineering:** Derived financial metrics (Principal, Installment-to-Income) using annuity formulas.
* **Explainability:** Used SHAP values to prove that FICO and Inquiry Velocity are the primary risk drivers.

This project is structured as a production-ready Python package.
