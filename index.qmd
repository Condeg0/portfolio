## Data Scientist & Quantitative Analyst

I am a final-year double major in **Econometrics** and **Information Science (Data Science)** at the University of South Florida.

**Valid decisions require solid evidence, yet they are rarely based on it.**

My focus is bridging that gap. I combine **econometric rigor** with **computational data science** to transform ambiguity into actionable intelligence. My goal is to replace intuition with inference, helping organizations optimize efficiency and solve complex real-world problems with precision.

### Professional Experience
- **Technology Director** | Hexa Consulting
- **Research Associate** | USF Student Investment Club (Macroeconomics)

### Key Projects
- **Credit Risk Optimization:** Developed a profit-maximizing threshold model for loan default prediction.
- **Tail Hedging Strategy:** Quantitative analysis of convex strategies for portfolio protection.
