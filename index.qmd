## Data Scientist & Quantitative Analyst

I am a double major in **Econometrics** and **Information Science (concentration in Data Science & Analytics)** at the University of South Florida (Class of 2026)

**I believe valid decisions require solid evidence, yet they are rarely based on it.**

My focus is bridging that gap. I combine **econometric rigor** with **data science** to transform ambiguity into actionable insights. My goal is to replace intuition with inference, helping organizations optimize efficiency and solve complex real-world problems with precision.

### Experience
- **Technology Director** | Hexa Junior Consulting Company
- **Research Associate** | USF Student Investment Club (Macroeconomics)
- **Tutor** | University of South Florida Athletics

### Key Projects
- **Credit Risk Optimization:** Developed a profit-maximizing threshold model for loan default prediction.
